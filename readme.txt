Full screen photo gallery lightbox which has optimally placed captions, social sharing, watermark, EXIF, etc. Fully customizable, Free.

== Description ==
Story Show Gallery is vertical scroll gallery lightbox optimized **for mobiles** (notch area included, even landscape mode). SSG will support your brand and marketing. It has optimally placed captions, no distracting arrows, full screen lightbox. **It's free**.
> [¬ª You can try Story Show Gallery here ‚ñ£ ‚ñ£ ‚ñ£ ](https://roman-flossler.github.io/StoryShowGallery/wordpress/)


SSG works with the standard WordPress gallery and images (classic or Gutenberg blocks). The galleries/images are fully managed by Wordpress, Story Show Gallery just displays them in full size in a **full screen lightbox** (WP doesn't have a default lightbox).

Story Show Gallery is already set up for standard functionality. But you can customise it with **over 50 options** - set a watermark, colour theme, borders, social sharing and much more.

You can activate/deactivate Story Show Gallery whenever you want, it doesn't make any changes to the Wordpress galleries.

**To enable** the Story Show Gallery lightbox, set the option **Link to** to **Media File** in the Wordpress gallery settings. For an image block, select Add Link from the toolbar, then select Media File option.

For developers: SSG only depends on jQuery library (which is part of the Wordpress). Optionally, it loads Exifr if you want to display camera info next to your photos.


### Your photos in the main role

Story Show Gallery aims to display your photos as if they were hanging in a gallery - you can configure the **photo frame**, choose background and there are no big, distracting arrows next to or over a photo. 

On smartphones, Story Show Gallery can use the **entire display** (including the notch area), there are no white sidebars like in other galleries.

Full screen mode works **like on You¬≠Tube**. It activa¬≠tes after rotating a phone into landscape mode. Also is possible to start the gallery in full screen portrait or forced landscape mode. 


### Browsing without clicking and thinking
Scrolling is the most natural way to interact with a website. Story Show Gallery **works like Facebook** - as a visitor scrolls down, new images are constantly loaded.

Story Show Gallery is **vertical**, making it ideal for use on mobile phones. In portrait mode, visitors typically see part of the next image and scroll to see the whole image.

### Brand building and social sharing
Story Show Gallery can display **your logo** or some text (emoji) over images. You can configure it in the SSG settings.

Social sharing icon is not put aside, it is part of the content, but subtle. A spectator's eyes will literally crash into **the sharing icon** at the end of a caption or in the corner of a photo. This can be disabled in the settings.

You can **deep link** into the gallery to show a specific image. Just use the URL address + image name in the hashtag -> [ssg.Flor.cz/#On-the-hOOk](https://ssg.flor.cz/#on-the-hook)

### Complete your photos with captions
With captions you can tell **the whole story** behind photos or amuse a spectator with some fun fact. Exif information can be included in captions.

Google treats captions like textual content. Especially if you don't have a lot of text on your page, captions will help your page rank higher in Google searches.

SSG is probably **the only gallery** that can place each caption individually according to image size vs. screen size. It is especially important on smartphones to use the whole screen.

### Some more features
* Optional **3D animation** of image thumbnails.
* **EXIF** info in captions and EXIF listing on click
* Support for **Google analytics**. Find out, how long site visitors view each photo and how many times.
* **4 visual themes**
* Optional animated transition when scrolling. It's a combination of scrolling and fading (similar to old slide projectors).
* **Protection of photos** from being copied via right click menu.
* Optional unobtrusive cursor.
